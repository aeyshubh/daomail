# DAO-MAIL
* DAO-MAIL aims to provide functionality of mailing service to DAO's for ease of communication in work flows.
* DAO-MAIL provides Token-gated access to Member's only chat .
* For eg:
    * Group Chat Access : No. of tokens <x(Eg : 5)
    * Admin Chat Access : No. of tokens >x(Eg: 10)

## Why to use :
* Reading Proposals from forum is quite time-consuming and not very interesting unless you are a dev.
* The DAO Admin can just fetch all DAO members using a click and can share a brief summary of any new proposal to all the members in few clicks.
* The members are fetched using ARAGON SDK using which the DAO is also created.
